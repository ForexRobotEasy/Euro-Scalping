# Euro Scalping Expert Advisor

This is the source code for the Euro Scalping Expert Advisor, which is an automated trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The Expert Advisor is optimized for the Roboforex broker and is designed to scalp the EUR/USD currency pair.

## Features

- Trades the EUR/USD currency pair
- Utilizes significant level criteria for trade entry
- Allows for customization of lot size, maximum number of simultaneous trades, and significant level criteria
- Implements a trailing stop for trade management

## How it Works

1. The Expert Advisor is initialized by checking if the broker is Roboforex. If not, a message is printed and the initialization fails.
2. The initial values for the number of trades executed, total profit earned, and total loss incurred are set.
3. On each tick, the Expert Advisor checks if the maximum number of trades has been reached. If not, it checks for significant levels.
4. If a significant level is detected, a trade is opened using the `OpenTrade()` function.
5. The `OpenTrade()` function calculates the take profit and stop loss levels based on the current bid and ask prices, and opens a buy trade using the `OrderSend()` function.
6. If a trade is successfully opened, a trailing stop is set using the `TrailingStopByPoints()` function.
7. The Expert Advisor handles trade errors and manages open trades in the `OnTradeError()` and `OnTrade()` functions, respectively.
8. When the Expert Advisor is deinitialized, the total trades executed, total profit earned, and total loss incurred are printed.
